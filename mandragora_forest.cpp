/* MANDRAGORA FOREST */
/*The evil forest is guarded by N vicious Mandragoras.
  Each Mandragora has H health points.
  Garnet and her pet begin their journey through the forest
  
  Initial Conditions:
  HEALTH S=1
  XP P=0
  
  To defeat ith Mandragora i, Garnet can perform either of the 
  following actions:
  
  1. Garnet's pet can eat Mandragora i. S increases by 1
     Mandragora i gets defeated. 
  2. Garnet's pet battles Mandragora i. This increases P by
     S x H experience points and defeats the Mandragora.
  Each Mandragora can only be defeated once, and Garnet can
  defeat the Mandragoras in any order. Each M's health points 
  are given. Find the maximum number of XPs she can earn from
  defeating all N Mandragoras
  INPUT:
    First Line: T ; Number of test cases
    In each test case:
        First Line: N; Number of Mandragoras
        Second Line: N space separated integers that represent
        the health of ith Mandragora.
        
   CONSTRAINTS:
    1 <= T <= 10^5
    1 <= N <= 10^5
    1 <= Hi <= 10^7, where 1<= i <=N
    
    OUTPUT:
    For each test case, print an integer denoting the max XPs
    possible
